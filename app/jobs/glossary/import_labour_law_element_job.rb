      Given the following Swedish legal text and its English translation, your task is to produce a glossary of the vocabulary.
      The glossary is a JSON array of objects containing the following properties:
        "word_text" is the column for the Swedish word,
        "translation_text" is for the corresponding English word,
        "source_text" is the full sentence in which the Swedish word appears,
        "target_text" is the English counterpart,
        and "root_text" is the singular, indefinite form of the Swedish word.
      A word should be included in the glossary even if it's not particularly advanced, but is formal, or longer than four letters and not cognate with English.
      Even if a word is cognate with English, it should be included if it's a legal term or has a specialized meaning.
      A word like 'uppnÃ¥' should be included.
      The returned JSON must be an array of objects, each object containing the properties "word_text", "translation_text", "source_text", "target_text", and "root_text".
      The returned JSON must be an array even if it contains only one object.
      Consider the entire text and do not just return the first few words.
