Hey there,

Due to a recent update to Arbetsmiljöverket's website, email notifications are
temporarily offline. They've changed how their site works in a way that prevents
666a's current notification system from detecting new documents.

It's probably fixable. I just need to update the notification system to understand
the new website layout. If you're curious about following the progress of the work,
or if you're interested in contributing, the GitHub issue URL is as follows.

In meantime, please just bear in mind that the reason you're not receiving
notifications from 666a is because notifications are offline. So it's possible for
you to miss something if you're not checking in with Arbetsmiljöverket's website
manually.

You should go check out the new design they've shipped anyway. It looks great and
they've introduced a new checkout flow for ordering documents. It's a big improvement
on the old email-based workflow they had before.

Thanks for your patience!

Henry
