About the lack of updates this week

Arbetsmiljöverket had a strange week this week (48). Nothing got published on
the diarium all week, and then suddenly the whole week's worth of documents
appeared all at once. That's why there weren't any email updated from 666a all
week, and now you're getting a bunch of them all at once.

I don't know what the deal was as I still don't have any contact with
Arbetsmiljöverket about this project. Thanks for waiting anyway. BTW if you ever
have any issues with the emails, you can reply to them to let me know. The
replies do come to my inbox.
