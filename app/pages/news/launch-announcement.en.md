# Announcing 666a

Public filings at the Swedish Work Environment Authority are essential for understanding organizations and the current work environment of companies. Keeping up to date is a prerequisite for driving sustainable development in the Swedish labour market. 666a is a modernization of Sweden's principle of public access to information, making information automatic, customized, and multilingual, rather than merely available.

## Origin

The idea for this tool comes from personal experience with union involvement in the workplace. As a union representative at Spotify, a problem I often encountered in my work was the difficulty of keeping up to date with public filings at the Work Environment Authority, which was information that was crucial to our campaign to secure a collective bargaining agreement.

666a is the tool I was missing. It's finally here.

If you have any questions, feedback, or thoughts on how the tool can be further developed, email me at henry@666a.se.
