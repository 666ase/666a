# All laws now up to date!

A few weeks ago I mentioned that preparations for [updating the English translation of the Work Environment Act](/news/lets-update-the-english-translation-of-the-work-environment-act) were complete. Even more good news now: not only is 666a's [English translation of the Work Environment Act](https://666a.se/labour-law/work-environment-act/2023:349) now completely up to date, but so is the [English translation of the Working Hours act](https://666a.se/labour-law/working-hours-act/2022:450)!

As far as I'm aware, right now 666a is now the only place on the web where you can get an up-to-date [English translation of Sweden's four most important labour laws](/labour-law). The ones on government.se are still out of date. And in the case of the Work Environment Act, more than a decade out of date.

Next up, I think I'd like to rescue the Parental Leave Act and the Annual Leave Act from the Swedish government's PDF compost heap. There's nearly a decade's worth of updates missing from the most recently published English translation of the Parental Leave Act too, so that one's going to take a minute or two to get polished and shipped on here.
