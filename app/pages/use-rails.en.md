# Use Rails

## Status

Accepted

## Context

666a needs a technical foundation. It's an application with a relatively simply UI, where most of the complexity lies in the back end and operational aspects. As an unfunded personal side project there's very little funding available for hosting services.

## Decision

Rails emerged as the right option after several months of exploration of other options.

## Consequences
