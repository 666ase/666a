# Going Open Source

Today's the six month anniversary of the launch of 666a. Wasn't completely sure anyone except me wanted it when I made it. Now that the demand is clear and I've had time to stabilise the service and prepare some documentation, it's time to upgrade it to an open source project. 

The repo's over at [https://github.com/666ase/666a](https://github.com/666ase/666a). Go chuck it a star if you have a GitHub account!

If you're interested in taking a deeper look, there's info about [setting up a 666a development environment](/development), some devops things to help [avoid disasters and facilitate recovering](/operations) from them when they do happen, and even some [architectural notes](/architecture).
