# About 666a

666a's mission is to provide 21st century tools for Sweden's labour movement. It's a mission inspired by first-hand experience of union organising. To build collective power in the digital era requires a modern approach.

666a is named after [chapter 6, section 6a of the Work Environment Act](/chapter-6-section-6a-of-aml-v2014:659-in-english). The first paragraph of that section empowers safety representatives to compel employers to engage with them on important work environment issues. A request made under that law is known colloquially within the Swedish labour movement as a "6:6a" â€“ pronounced <em lang="sv">sex-sexa</em> in Swedish.
