# Announcing 666a

Public filings at the Work Environment Authority are one of the key everyday forces that move the Swedish labour market forwards.
But keeping up-to-date with them has always meant remembering to go to the Work Environment Authority's website and manually search for new filings. 
Not any more.
666a is here to empower union representatives, safety officers, and their central union collaborators with a way to stay informed automatically.

Instead of manually navigating to the Work Environment Authority's website and searching for new filings, 666a enables an overworked safety officer or union representative to configure an automated email alert for a given company.
From there, they can rest easy knowing that they'll be notified if any new filings are posted.

666a is an email notification service borne from real-world experience on the front lines of Sweden's labour movement.
At Spotify in 2023, members were hungry for news about the employer's night work dispute with the Work Environment Authority.
But the newly-formed Unionen club was overwhelmed with its many day-to-day operational duties, and it was easy to forget to check for new filings.
Contacts at other companies shared similar experiences.
666a is just a tool we all wished already existed, and finally someone's actually built it.

The launch of this new service happens in the context of a Swedish government that's actively undermining worker power in the labour market.
The recent guidance to the Work Environment Authority about increasing the number of safety officers "regardless of union membership" has been widely interpreted as a between-the-lines attack on union influence over the work environment.
666a is an emphatic rejection of the notion that workers in Sweden stand to gain anything from flooding the labour market with isolated, ineffective safety officers.
Our collective power and mutual support is the only thing that can give workers true influence over our workplaces.

This is a free tool.
It's available to absolutely anyone.
It'll almost certainly be well-received in Sweden's tech industry, where the comparative lack of Collective Bargaining Agreements makes employer collaboration relatively poor in comparison with the rest of the Swedish economy.
It's no replacement for MBL 11 negotiations, but if you don't have a Collective Bargaining Agreement,  you'll take what you can get.

Hopefully people from other sectors will find value in it as well.
It would be exciting if 666a helped bridge the gap between Sweden's tech workers and those in other sectors with more union experience.
Later, if the service gains enough traction, we can potentially experiment with some opt-in networking ideas.
Not enough of us in the Swedish labour movement are in touch with each other, that's for sure.
