# Announcing 666a

Public filings at the Work Environment Authority are one of the key everyday forces that move the Swedish labour market forwards.
But keeping up-to-date with them has always meant remembering to go to the Work Environment Authority's website and manually search for new filings. 
Not any more.
666a is here to empower union representatives, safety officers, and their central union collaborators with a way to stay informed automatically.

Instead of manually navigating to the Work Environment Authority's website and searching for new filings, 666a enables an overworked safety officer or union representative to configure an automated email alert for a given company.
From there, they can rest easy knowing that they'll be notified if any new filings are posted.

666a is an email notification service borne from real-world experience on the front lines of Sweden's labour movement.
At Spotify in 2023, members were hungry for news about the employer's night work dispute with the Work Environment Authority.
But the newly-formed Unionen club was overwhelmed with its many day-to-day operational duties.
Remembering to check the diarium regularly was hard, which was a burden on our situational awareness.
Friends at other companies shared similar experiences.
666a is basically just a tool we wished already existed, and now finally it does.

The launch of this new service happens in the context of a Swedish government that's actively undermining worker power in the labour market.
The recent guidance to the Work Environment Authority about increasing the number of safety officers "regardless of union membership" has been widely interpreted as an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of the role by increasing the proportion of practitioners lacking vital outside support.
666a is an emphatic rejection of the notion that workers in Sweden stand to gain anything from flooding the labour market with isolated, ineffective safety officers.
Our collective power and mutual support is the only thing that can give workers true, lasting influence over our workplaces.

This is a free tool.
It's available to absolutely anyone.
It'll almost certainly be well-received in Sweden's tech industry, where the comparative lack of Collective Bargaining Agreements makes employer collaboration relatively poor in comparison with the rest of the Swedish economy.
It's no replacement for MBL 11 negotiations, but if you don't have a Collective Bargaining Agreement, 666a will sure as hell make it harder to keep you in the dark.

Hopefully people from other sectors will find value in it as well.
The Klarna Unionen club has unleashed a wave of new organising in Sweden's tech sector, but we're still relatively isolated from the rest of the country's labour movement.
I'd love if this could also be a useful tool for folks in the more mature end of the movement at unions like Kommunal, Byggnads, and IF Metall.
Anything you can do to help spread the word about 666a is awesome, but I'll be especially grateful to anyone who helps break the news _outside_ the tech bubble.

And don't be a stranger.
