# Terms of Service

Abusive accounts will be terminated without notice. This service is a
volunteer-driven effort so the definition of abuse is intentionally very broad
and fluid to begin with as resources are extremely limited. As an individual
signing up for one account in your real name and using it for its intended
purpose of receiving email alerts about a company of your choosing, you don't
need to worry. If you're circumventing the limitations of the system in any way
you're on thin ice.
